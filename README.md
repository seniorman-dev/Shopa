# shopa

//App Overview:
Shopa is a simple platform that allows it's user (ideally a Fashion Vendor/S.M.E) to View, Save, Update and Delete their products seamlessly.
It encompasses a search filtering functionality whereby the user can filter through their products based on category (e.g clothes or shoes).


//Setting up 'Shopa' locally on your machine:
*First things first, make sure you have 'Git' downloaded and successfully installed in your system (e.g Windows, MacOS, Linux).

*Next, cd into any directory of your choice and run the command "git clone https://github.com/seniorman-dev/Shopa.git" to clone/download the file from my github.

*Once cloning is successful, launch the flutter project in VS-CODE or Android Studio and run the command "flutter pub get" in your terminal to fetch and install Flutter's Dependencies.

*Make sure you IDE is connected to a device before running "flutter run" to launch the application on your Emulator.


//Design Decision:
During my research for smooth UI designs, i stumbled upon an E-commerce mobile design that looked so appealing featuring it's blend of just white, black, grey and orange colors. I was inspired by the color presentation (less color used), user feel and experience hence, i decided to replicate it's design pattern for "Shopa". 
There were no trade offs and all was great generally.


//State Management Solution:
GetX being a fast, robust and light-weight state management solution was used to manage the application's state. it facilitates the application's Dependency Injections, Overall State Management, Navigation & Routing, e.t.c.
Thank's to GetX's fantastic routing system, this mobile application can be hosted on a domain as a web application with it's routing, performance and functionalities still intact.



//NB: run "flutter test" to test all files in your test directory simultaneously.
